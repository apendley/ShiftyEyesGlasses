Adaptation of the 'roboface' animation for the Adafruit IS31FL3741 LED Glasses. 

I borrowed the concept and a good bit of code from the 'roboface' example in the Adafruit LED backpack library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack/) and adapted it to the nifty LED Glasses by Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5210). I used the Adafruit nRF52840 LED Glasses Driver (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5217), but this code should work on most microcontrollers with little or no adjustment (though on  slower microcontrollers you may want to increase the update interval until the animation is smooth).
